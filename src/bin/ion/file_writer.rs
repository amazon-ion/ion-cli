/// A buffered `io::Write` implementation that implements [`WriteColor`] by reporting that it does
/// not support TTY escape sequences and treating all requests to change or reset the current color
/// as no-ops.
//
// When writing to a file instead of a TTY, we don't want to use `termcolor` escape sequences as
// they would be stored as literal bytes rather than being interpreted. To achieve this, we need an
// `io::Write` implementation that also implements `termcolor`'s `WriteColor` trait. `WriteColor`
// allows the type to specify to whether it supports interpreting escape codes.
//
// We cannot implement `WriteColor` for `BufWriter<File>` directly due to Rust's coherence rules. Our
// crate must own the trait, the implementing type, or both. The `FileWriter` type defined below
// is a simple wrapper around a `BufWriter<File>` that implements both `io::Write` and `termcolor`'s
// `WriteColor` trait.
